# 100daysMLChallenge
I am taking up the challenge to learn Machine Learning at least an hour everyday!
I log everyday's progress in [here.](https://github.com/reisd/100daysMLChallenge/tree/master/LOG.md)

I ended up not finishing 100days challenge but I'm proud that I can work on the ML study/projects for over 2 months. I'll come back with another project.

## Progress made so far
1. Andrew Deep Learning specilization course #1,2,3
2. K-means, TF-IDF, SVM, LDA

## Projects or courses in progress
