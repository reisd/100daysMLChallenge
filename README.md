# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have set up all the things I will do in the next 7 days. I will make sure I am spending one quality hour on coding ML and try to spend 1 hour ML related courses and 1 hour Kaggle competition.

**Thoughts** : I am very excited to start this journey.


## Day 1 : Jul 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have completed Andrew's DL 1st course - Week 4 assignments.

**Thoughts** : It was quite challenging to find the right caches in the back propagation but I made that work and learned a lot during the process. I will visit it back on July 10th, 2018 to get myself familiar with the different help functions.

## Day 2 : Jul 10 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have watched the three videos of 2nd course week 1.

**Thoughts** : The videos were easy to understand and hope I can use some of them in real project.

**Today's Progress** : I have five regularization videos of 2nd course week 1 and learned three different ways to prevent overfitting.

## Day 5 : Jul 13 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I finished initialized part hands-on exercises.

**Thoughts** : initializing parameters make a lot of differences. I planned to do all the hands-on exericses but I am too tired now so I will spend more time learning tomorrow since tomorrow is saturday!!!
