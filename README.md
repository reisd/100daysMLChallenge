# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : June 30 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : Jul 1 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have completed data preparation for kaggle ml problem .

**Thoughts** : It is really challenging and many error occured , but I have debuged them . It was really fun .

## Day 2 : Jul 2 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have completed initial training and testing of the model and submitted to the Kaggle . 

**Thoughts** : The score have to be improved I will try my best on it and it is really fun .

## Day 3 : Jul 3 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have completed Google ML crash course upto reduce data loss .

**Thoughts** : The course is really good and it contain lots of good contents . It is good for a beginner .

## Day 4 : Jul 4 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have done more of Google ML crash course .

**Thoughts** : The programing exercises are good.

## Day 5 : Jul 5 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have implemented Linear regression model algorithm from scratch and used it to prediction .

**Thoughts** : The builtin tools or models we use are also just algorithms , they are not any rocket science , learning ML become more fun when these algorithms are implemented from scratch , it was really a great experience .

## Day 6 : Jul 6 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned about Gradient descent algorithm and its equations .

**Thoughts** : the concepts are really good .
