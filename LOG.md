# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have set up all the things I will do in the next 7 days. I will make sure I am spending one quality hour on coding ML and try to spend 1 hour ML related courses and 1 hour Kaggle competition.

**Thoughts** : I am very excited to start this journey.


## Day 1 : Jul 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have completed Andrew's DL 1st course - Week 4 assignments.

**Thoughts** : It was quite challenging to find the right caches in the back propagation but I made that work and learned a lot during the process. I will visit it back on July 10th, 2018 to get myself familiar with the different help functions.

## Day 2 : Jul 10 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have watched the three videos of 2nd course week 1.

**Thoughts** : The videos were easy to understand and hope I can use some of them in real project.

## Day 3 : Jul 11 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have five regularization videos of 2nd course week 1 and learned three different ways to prevent overfitting.

**Thoughts** : I would like to see how I can implement this in python tomorrow's exercises and future projects!

## Day 4 : Jul 12 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have six videos of 2nd course week 1 and learned the ways of how to set up for optimization and finished the quiz!

**Thoughts** : I am ready to work on the assignment.

## Day 5 : Jul 13 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I finished initialization part hands-on exercises.

**Thoughts** : initializing parameters make a lot of differences. I planned to do all the hands-on exericses but I am too tired now so I will spend more time learning tomorrow since tomorrow is saturday!!!

## Day 6 : Jul 14 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I finished rest of hands-on exercises in week 1 and watched two videos of week 2.

**Thoughts** : Hands-on exercises are well designed and I know how to apply those regularization skills now. I am thinking to find some time in this week to review the codes before because I was focusing on solving the problems as fast as I can. I decided to finish this specilization as soon as I can and then start to work on Kaggle projects. Tomorrow is Sunday and at least I would like to get week 2 done.

## Day 7 : Jul 15 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I watched all of week 2's videos and passed the quiz.

**Thoughts** : Optimization techniques will be very useful. I look forward to using it in hands-on assignment, kaggle competition projects or projects in work!! Working on the videos and exercises during the weekend needs lots of disciplines but I am glad I made it tonight! Hopefully I can finish course 2 and course 3 in the next coming week!

## Day 8 : Jul 16 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I worked on the hands-on assignment for 30 minutes but could not finish it. Also discussed how to apply LDA to our real project with my friends.

**Link of Work:**  N/A today


## Day 10 : Jul 18 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I watched three videos late night. I stopped at fourth video because I am just so tired now. Need to rest.

**Thoughts** : Hyperparameter tuning process doesn't seem fun. I sacrificed Machine learning study time for an'critical' and 'urgent' task so I thought I could find another time to watch it but... I was doing other stuff and came back at home 10:10 PM. I was able to study for 40ish minutes but not efficient at all! Lessons learned - NEVER compromise GOLDEN morning Machine learning time.
